# TimeKiller (Chronos and Aion)
a fast white-box snapshot isolation (SI) checker based on timestamps

## Requirements

* JDK 8 (or above)
* Maven

## Install

Clone this repository, enter the project root directory, and run

```sh
mvn install
mvn package
```

Then you will get `TimeKiller-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in `target/`.

You can move it to anywhere according to your workspace (e.g. the project root directory).

For the sake of simplicity, I strongly recommend renaming it to `TimeKiller.jar`.

## Quick start

Run TimeKiller by specifying a history to check.

```sh
java -jar TimeKiller.jar --history_path examples/quick-start.json
```

The output is like this:

```text

It's pretty _quick_, isn't it? You have successfully checked 100k transactions in only 1 second!

## Customize running

```

Note that these options cannot be arbitrarily combined as shown in the descriptions. For detail, please see below.

### Run Chronos

Set `--mode` to `fast` or `gc` to run Chronos, performing a one-shot offline checking of an existing history.

Under `fast` or `gc` mode:

* `--history_path` is a **required** option to set the path of json-format history. The file must have `.json` extension.
* `--enable_session, --initial_value, --data_model, --fix` are valid options.

Under `fast` mode:

* All other options will be ignored.

Under `gc` mode:

* `--num_per_gc` is a valid option.
* All other options will be ignored.

### Input file format

For key-value histories, the input json file must have the following format.

```json
[
    {
        "tid": 67,
        "sid": 19,
        "sts": {"p": 1691420095436341, "l": 61},
        "cts": {"p": 1691420095659914, "l": 18},
        "ops": [
            {"t": "w", "k": 7, "v": 2},
            {"t": "w", "k": 4, "v": 5},
            {"t": "r", "k": 8, "v": 3}
        ]
    }
]
```

The whole file is a json array consisting of transaction objects:

* `tid` means transaction id, a unique identifier for each transaction. It can be a string.
* `sid` means session id, a unique identifier for each session. The transaction is executed on this session. It can be a string.
* `sts` means start timestamp, which is a hybrid logical clock (HLC). `p` and `l` respectively stand for the physical and logical part of the timestamp. If the transaction does not have a logical timestamp, it's ok to set `l` to `0`. And `p` is not required to actually represent a physical clock. It can be an incrementing logical tick (usually in which case `l` is `0`). `p` and `l` must be (long) integers.
* `cts` means commit timestamp, which is also a HLC. It must be greater than or equal to the `sts` in a transaction.
* `ops` means operations, an array of operations:
  * `t` means type of the operation. Possible values are `w, r, write, read` (not case sensitive).
  * `k` means key of the operation. It must be a (long) integer.
  * `v` means value of the operation. It must be a (long) integer or `null`. If the latter it can be omitted.

See `examples/format-kv.json` for a complete key-value history sample.

For list histories, the only difference is the format of each operation:

```json
[
    {"t": "a", "k": 3, "v": 1},
    {"t": "r", "k": 6, "v": [4, 5, 9]}
]
```

* `t` can be one of `a, r, append, read` (not case sensitive).
* `k` is the same as above.
* `v` has different formats according to `t`. If the operation is an append then `v` is a (long) integer. Otherwise (the operation is a read), `v` is a list consisting of (long) integers. If `v` is an empty list then it can be set to `null` or be omitted.

See `examples/format-list.json` for a complete list history sample.

### Run Aion

Set `--mode` to `online` to run Aion, performing a continuous online checking by receiving HTTP requests of a history.

Under `online` mode:

* `--enable_session, --initial_value` are valid options just like Chronos.
* `--port, --timeout_delay, --use_cts_as_rtts, --duration_in_memory, --log_ext_flip, --txn_start_gc, --max_txn_in_mem, --gc_interval` are valid options **only** under `online` mode.
* All other options will be ignored.

### HTTP request format

Aion checks transactions sent through HTTP requests. Each request is sent to `http://127.0.0.1:23333/check` (by default) via POST method carrying json data of transactions. If `--use_cts_as_rtts` is set to `true`, the json data has the same format as the key-value histories accepted by Chronos described above. Otherwise, for each transaction in the json array, it needs an additional field `rtts`, a millisecond timestamp.

Note that the json data must be a json array, even if the request carries only one transaction. This is designed to encourage the use of batch processing.

### Detailed description of options

If you are confused by the numerous configuration options, donâ€™t worry. After reading this section you will have a comprehensive and detailed understanding of them.
